# Text answers from Week 0

# Name: Alex



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer: First line imports TurtleWorld file so instances of TurtleWorld objects can be created
		and functions in the TurtleWorld file can be used.
	Second line creates a world object, the screen that the turtle navigates in
	Third line creates a turtle object that sits in the middle of the world
	Fourth line pauses and waits for the user to close, otherwise the window will close
		on its own, the world will terminate once the code is complete

These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer: 4 arguments: t has to be a Turtle; n is the number of sides, so it has to be an 
	integer; length of each side should be a positive number, and angle must be a 
	number, understood in degrees

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: 1st we need to figure out the angle to turn the turtle, 360 / n sides.
	2nd we need to use Polyline function to draw the polygon, by providing the turtle,
		n number of sides, length of each side, and the angle of each turn

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer:	4 arguments: t Turtle object; n number of sides, length of each side, angle of each turn




Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: Move function, requires pen up pu(turtle) function, then fd or bk(turtle, radius = 100), pen down pd(turtle), and lt or rt(turtle)

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: Another move function, lt or rt(turtle) the reverse of above, pen up pu(turtle), fd or bk(turtle, 100) reverse of above, then if desired, pd(turtle) 

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: precondition and postcondition?
